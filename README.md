# Own AI Model - Local LLM Deployment

## Overview
A privacy-first, cloud-free environment for running and interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) locally. This project demonstrates both Python and JavaScript integrations with Ollama and LLaMA 3, featuring a modern, responsive web interface and secure, offline AI inference.

## Features
- **Local LLM Inference**: Run LLaMA 3 models on your own machine using Ollama
- **No Cloud Dependency**: 100% offline, ensuring maximum privacy and data security
- **Python API Integration**: Send prompts and receive responses using Python (`requests`)
- **Modern Web UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Real-Time Answers**: Instant responses from your local model via browser
- **Interactive Experience**: Type questions, get answers—no third-party servers involved
- **Easy Model Management**: Pull and switch models with Ollama CLI

## Technologies Used
- **Ollama** – Local LLM runtime
- **LLaMA 3 / 3.2** – Meta’s advanced language model
- **OpenRouter API** – For flexible LLM integration
- **Python** – Backend scripting and API calls
- **JavaScript (fetch API)** – Frontend API communication
- **HTML5 & CSS3** – Responsive, modern UI

---

## Why Local LLMs?
- Full control over your data and models
- No vendor lock-in or cloud costs
- Maximum privacy and security
- Always available—even offline
- Blazing fast, real-time inference

## How It Works
1. **Install Ollama** and pull the LLaMA 3 model
2. **Run Ollama** locally to serve the model
3. **Python script** or **JavaScript frontend** sends prompts to the local Ollama server
4. **Model responds** instantly—no internet required
